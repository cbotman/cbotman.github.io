            I love illustration and verse, so have a soft spot for illustrated
            kids books. Recommendations below. I'd love to receive suggestions,
            also.

        <h2>Books for a 4 year old</h2>
        <h3>
            <em>Dream Little One, Dream</em> by Sally Morgan and Ambelin
            Kwaymullina
        </h3>
        <p><em>Insects buzz a story of the earth</em></p>
        <h3><em>Magic Beach</em> by Alison Lester</h3>
        <p>
            I live near the beach, and it is indeed magic. Probably my single
            favourite book to read to my daughter. I can (and do) recite this
            book from memory, word-for-word. Alison's illustration style is
            fantastic ('ink and wash', I think), and her books are full of
            imagination. We have several, and they're all good, but
            <em>Magic Beach</em> is best of all.
