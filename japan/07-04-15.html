		<h1>15th April, 2007</h1>
		<h2>Amerikamura, Dotonbori, and Den Den Town</h2>
		<p>These photos and onwards I've uploaded since getting back to New Zealand, so the captions will be as best as I remember what I was taking a photo of&hellip;</p>
		<p>Between these photos and when I visited Nara, I mostly just stuffed around Osaka, checking out shops (especially music and book stores (I wish I could read Japanese)), etc.</p>

			<p>One end of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=D%C5%8Dtonbori&oldid=130002193">Dotonbori</a>. This is where all the flashy lights and stuff are at night (pics of that later). This area influenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blade_Runner&oldid=132992882">Blade Runner</a>.</p>

			<p>Hmm, that girl facing the camera is cute, I should have paid more attention.</p>

			<p>(Roll your mouse on and off the crab.)</p>
			
			<p>The best thing about this picture is it gives me a chance to say the words "eye stalks". The crab has moving eye stalks.</p>

			<p>So the reason I was in town this day was to visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nipponbashi&oldid=124812490">Den Den Town</a>. However, it was one of the very few places in Japan that disappointed me.</p>
			<p>The area is billed as an electronics district, and yeah, there were some computer and camera shops there, but half the shops were just porn (mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hentai&oldid=133318494">hentai</a>). Typical shops would be computers or toys on floor one, dodgy toys down the back, and three floors of porn above.</p>
			<p>Saw some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cosplay_restaurant&oldid=131952597">Maid Cafes</a> but didn't go in any (honest)! They look cute, but I'm not comfortable being waited on, let alone by a girl dressed as a French maid pretending to be my little-sister.</p>

			<p>So yeh, it was disappointing to see what could have been a geek haven to be so sleezy. Who buys porn anyway, don't they have the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5430343841227974645">internet</a>?</p>
