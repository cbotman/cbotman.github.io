		<h1>6th April, 2007</h1>
		<h2>Nara</h2>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nara%2C_Nara&amp;oldid=119706832">Nara</a> is nice. Not a lot else to say on that.</p>
		<p>You couldn't take photos inside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=K%C5%8Dfuku-ji&amp;oldid=120358351">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> Treasure Hall, but I loved this <a href="http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/japan/kofukuji8.html"> (slightly larger-than-life) wood-sculpture</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nio&amp;oldid=109528223">Kongo Rikishi</a>.</p>

			<p>Apologies if you were blinded by this pic.</p>
			<p>This is Kofuku-ji Temple. The pagoda begins to look very heavy if you stand under it and look up.</p>
		</div>

			<a href="07-04-06/02-large.jpg"><img src="07-04-06/02.jpg" alt="" class="landscape" /></a>
			<p>I think this is the Great South Gate to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T%C5%8Ddai-ji&amp;oldid=120358389">Todai-ji Temple</a>.</p>
			<p>Note the tame deer, which wander around a lot of Nara. I'm not sure I believe the story about them learning to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nara%2C_Nara&amp;oldid=119706832#Wildlife_in_Nara">bow to visitors</a> though. I think they learned all they need to do is stand beside food stalls.</p>

			<p>The Great Buddha Hall at Todai-ji Temple. Possibly the largest wooden building in the world. It's been rebuilt twice after fire damage, and used to be a third larger still.</p>
			<p>I think I'm holding my fortune (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Omikuji&oldid=98795762">Omikuji</a>): Late Good Luck.</p>
			<p><em>You may have a difficulty in finding a way-out at a moment. A right way will be found soon later.</em></p>

		<div class="photo">

			<p>There is no way to get a sense of scale from this photo, but that's a 15 meter tall Buddha.</p>
		</div>

			<p><em>One of the supporting posts in the Great Buddha Hall has a hole that has been bored through the base. Visitors try to pass through the hole which is said to be the same size as one of the Daibutsu's nostrils. Legend has it that those who pass through it will be blessed with enlightenment in their next life. Children usually have no trouble getting through but adults sometimes get stuck and need to be pulled out.</em></p>

			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kasuga_Shrine&amp;oldid=119624364">Kasuga Shrine</a>.</p>

			<a href="07-04-06/08-large.jpg"><img src="07-04-06/08.jpg" alt="" class="landscape" /></a>
			<p>Outside Kasuga Shrine. There's a slight creepiness to this place (the lanterns are everywhere and continue into the forest), but it's lost in the photos.</p>
