            This page is a list of my favourite retro games that
            <em>still hold up well</em> and are fun to play today (circa 2023)
            despite being over 20 or even 30 years old.

        <h2>DOS, Commodore-Amiga, and/or PC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ancient Art of War in the Sky</li>
            <li>The Settlers 2</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sega Mega Drive (aka Sega Genesis)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mega-Lo-Mania - has a great mechanic that rewards efficient play
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sony PSX</h2>
        <p>
            The original PlayStation was not my first console, but definitely
            was and still is my favourite. I cannot overstate my love of that

                >reverb-laden boot sound</a
            >. If you are running a PSX emulator, you might notice unless you
            provide an official bios, it doesn't include the startup sound. Be
            sure to fix that. Actually, I will provide some tips and useful
            links on emulating PSX later.

            Sony also made
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hkcV8MTvjM"
                >the greatest video game TV advert ever</a
            >
            for the PlayStation. I remember it as an advert for PS1, but looking
            now it was actually PS2. Here's the full short-film the advert came
            from:

                >Wolfman, by Tim Hope</a
            >.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</li>
            <li>
                Crash Bandicoot (the whole series) -
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HP8y1asAyo&t=32"
                    >the first level in Crash 3 Warped</a
                >
                is the first thing I try to get going when setting up an
                emulator. That music :chef's kiss:
            </li>
            <li>Command &amp; Conquer + Red Alert</li>
            <li>Destruction Derby 2</li>
            <li>
                Final Fantasy 7 - I was lucky enough to play this when it came
                out. It's such a great and iconic game, though I probably perfer
                the Switch version today because you can skip random battles.
                That said, the graphics on the Switch version are a bit jarring,
                with sharp 3D on blurry 2D backgrounds.
            </li>
            <li>Spyro (the whole series)</li>
            <li>
                Theme Hospital - The game is probably better on PC, but I've
                been playing the PSX port on my Vita.
            </li>
            <li>Twisted Metal 2</li>
        </ul>
