      This page is a list of my favourite retro games, most of which still hold
      up well and are fun to play today (circa 2023) despite being over 20 or
      even 30 years old.

    <p>ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§</p>
    <h2>MS-DOS, Commodore Amiga, 486, and/or Pentium PC</h2>
    <ul>
      <!-- <li><em>Arthur</em> - Played on the public library computers before we had a computer at home.</li> -->
      <li><em>Civilization 2 &amp; 3</em></li>
      <li><em>Dune 2</em></li>
      <li><em>Masters of Orion 2</em></li>
      <li><em>Sid Meier's Pirates!</em></li>
      <li><em>SimAnt</em></li>
      <li><em>SimCity 2000</em></li>
      <li><em>The Ancient Art of War in the Sky</em></li>
      <li><em>The Settlers 2</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sega Mega Drive (aka Sega Genesis)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Mega-Lo-Mania</em> - has a great mechanic that rewards efficient
        play
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sony PSX</h2>
    <p>
      The original PlayStation was not my first console, but definitely was and
      still is my favourite. I cannot overstate my love of the
      <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DIxUScfOQwg"
        >reverb-laden boot sound</a
      >. If you are running a PSX emulator, you might notice without an official
      bios the game will run without showing the proper boot screen when it
      starts. Be sure to fix that. Actually, I will provide some tips and useful
      links on emulating PSX in future.

      Sony also made
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hkcV8MTvjM"
        >this great 'I am the wolfman' TV advert</a
      >
      for the PlayStation. I remember it as an advert for PS1, but looking now
      it was actually PS2. Here's the full short-film the advert came from:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkxZf9LvLpI"
        ><em>Wolfman</em>, by Tim Hope</a
      >. There are
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/20yearsofplay">other gems</a>
      too -- I do recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwgdZxYL-E"></a>Mountain</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Ace Combat 2</em></li>
      <li><em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em></li>
      <li>
        <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> (the whole series) -
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HP8y1asAyo&t=32"
          >the first level in Crash 3 Warped</a
        >
        is the first thing I try to get going when setting up an emulator. That
        music :chef's kiss:
      </li>
      <li><em>Colony Wars</em></li>
      <li><em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> &amp; <em>C&C Red Alert</em></li>
      <li><em>Destruction Derby 2</em></li>
      <li><em>Die Hard Trilogy</em></li>
      <li>
        <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> - I was lucky enough to play this when it
        came out. It's such a great and iconic game, though I probably perfer
        the Switch version today because you can skip random battles. That said,
        the graphics on the Switch version are a bit jarring, with sharp 3D on
        blurry 2D backgrounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> - It's possible I love the soundtrack
        more than the game, which I found punishingly hard. A friend sunk
        serious time into this though and I was very impressed when he got Cloud
        Strife in his party.
      </li>
      <li><em>Spyro</em> (the whole series)</li>
      <li><em>Tekken 3</em></li>
      <li>
        <em>Theme Hospital</em> - The game is probably better on PC, but I've
        been playing the PSX port on my Vita.
      </li>
      <li><em>Tenchu</em></li>
      <li>
        <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 &amp; 2</em> - Great games and showed off
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQPjxFDDGcg&t=345s"
          >the power of CDs with their soundtracks</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li><em>Twisted Metal 2</em></li>
    </ul>
