            This page is a list of my favourite retro games, most of which still
            hold up well and are fun to play today (circa 2023) despite being
            over 20 or even 30 years old.

        <h2>DOS, Commodore-Amiga, and/or PC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>The Ancient Art of War in the Sky</em></li>
            <li><em>The Settlers 2</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sega Mega Drive (aka Sega Genesis)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Mega-Lo-Mania</em> - has a great mechanic that rewards
                efficient play
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sony PSX</h2>
        <p>
            The original PlayStation was not my first console, but definitely
            was and still is my favourite. I cannot overstate my love of the
            <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DIxUScfOQwg"
                >reverb-laden boot sound</a
            >. If you are running a PSX emulator, you might notice without an
            official bios the game will run without showing the proper boot
            screen when it starts. Be sure to fix that. Actually, I will provide
            some tips and useful links on emulating PSX in future.

            Sony also made

                >this great 'I am the wolfman' TV advert</a
            >
            for the PlayStation. I remember it as an advert for PS1, but looking
            now it was actually PS2. Here's the full short-film the advert came
            from:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkxZf9LvLpI"

            >.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Ace Combat 2</em></li>
            <li><em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em></li>
            <li>
                <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> (the whole series) -
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HP8y1asAyo&t=32"
                    >the first level in Crash 3 Warped</a
                >
                is the first thing I try to get going when setting up an
                emulator. That music :chef's kiss:
            </li>
            <li><em>Colony Wars</em></li>
            <li><em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> &amp; <em>C&C Red Alert</em></li>
            <li><em>Destruction Derby 2</em></li>
            <li><em>Die Hard Trilogy</em></li>
            <li>
                <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> - I was lucky enough to play this when
                it came out. It's such a great and iconic game, though I
                probably perfer the Switch version today because you can skip
                random battles. That said, the graphics on the Switch version
                are a bit jarring, with sharp 3D on blurry 2D backgrounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> - It's possibly I love the
                soundtrack more than the game, which I found punishingly hard.
                My friend sunk serious time into this though, and I remember he
                had unlocked Cloud Strife in his party.
            </li>
            <li><em>Spyro</em> (the whole series)</li>
            <li><em>Tekken 3</em></li>
            <li>
                <em>Theme Hospital</em> - The game is probably better on PC, but
                I've been playing the PSX port on my Vita.
            </li>
            <li><em>Tenchu</em></li>
            <li><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 &amp; 2</em></li>
            <li><em>Twisted Metal 2</em></li>
