        <h1>Chris Botman's homepage</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my homepage! A little place on the web I can go
            full-nerd. This is not a blog,
            <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/"
                >we're going old-school</a
            >
            here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm an aspiring indie game developer, sharing my game(s) and some of
            the inspiration behind them. Hopefully this will weave together
            threads of interest well suited to sharing on the web: retro gaming
            (especially PS1 and PC), fantasy and sci-fi (e.g.
            <em>D&D</em>, <em>Star Trek TNG</em>, <em>X-Files</em>) and a bit of
            Japanese pop-culture. In other words, I'm a millennial (or Gen Y, as
            we used to be called) nerd, bitten by the nostalgia bug.

            My homepage is not an attempt to document all of my interests or
            everything I do. I'm engaged in many things: being a dad and
            husband, hobbies (gardening, art, music, walking and reading), work,
            and trying to leave Earth a better place than I found it (not going
            well). But beyond this little statement, I don't really plan to talk
            about those things here.

        <h2>Games</h2>
        <h3><em>Super RPG Town</em></h3>
        <p>
            I'm working on a playable demo of the core game loop, so will share
            more when that's ready. Inspired by the gameplay of
            <em>Majesty</em> and <em>Dragon Quest Builders</em>, the visual
            style of old 2D tile-based RPGs such as <em>Ultima V</em>, the
            spirit of countless <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> adventures, and
            a feeling I still remember from the first time I logged into an
            MMORPG (<em>Dransik</em>), created a character and set forwarth into
            a wide open world.

                Dave is a passionate Japanese woodblock print maker. You have
                quite possibly seen the work that made him Internet-famous, the

                watching and listening to Dave. Here's one of my favourite
                prints (link is to a gallery website Dave created):

                EGM was a popular console game magazine my older brother and I
                read at high school in the late '90s. Scans of every issue are
                available! Go back to a time before mobile phones, revisit the
                emergence of the web, enjoy fan art sent in the mail, but most
                of all, relive the glory of PSX, N64, and the unexpectedly long
                run of the GameBoy thanks to a small game from Japan called
                <em>Pocket Monster</em> (also Sega consoles, <em>*sniff*</em>).

                collector (and pals). I decided not to collect physical games
                and stick to emulation, but I am happily live vicariously
                through Metal Jesus.
