    <h1>Chris Botman's homepage</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my homepage! This
      is not a blog,
      <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/"
        >we're going old-school</a
      >
      here. I'm a millennial (or Gen Y, as we used to be called?) nerd, bitten by the nostalgia bug (especially for late-'90s, early '00s gaming and tech).
    </p>
    <p>
      My homepage is not an attempt to document all of my interests or
      everything I do. I'm engaged in many things: being a dad and husband,
      hobbies (gardening, art, music, reading, and being outside), work, and
      trying to leave Earth a better place than I found it (not going well). But
      beyond this little statement, I don't really plan to talk about those
      things here.

        EGM was a popular console game magazine my older brother and I read at
        high school in the late '90s. Check out scans of most issues! Go back to
        a time before mobile phones, revisit the emergence of the web, enjoy fan
        art sent in the mail, but most of all, relive the glory of PSX, N64, and
        the unexpectedly long run of the GameBoy thanks to a small game from
        Japan called <em>Pocket Monster</em> (also Sega consoles,
        <em>*sniff*</em>). After browsing these scans, I started (re)collecting
        EGM issues from the 1996-2001 era...<br />

        In highschool, my best friend and I were fans of professional wrestling
        during the legendary Attitude Era. Maven was a WWE mid-carder who came
        along later, and now vlogs. I knew wrestling was 'fake', but had no idea
        just how physically demanding it still was. Maven's storytelling made me
        appriciate the althleticism required and hooked me on wrestling again.
