        <h1>Chris Botman's homepage</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my homepage! A small place on the web I can go full-nerd.
            This is not a blog,
            <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/"
                >we're going old-school</a
            >
            here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm an aspiring indie game developer, sharing my game(s) and some of
            the inspiration behind them. Hopefully this will weave together
            threads of interest that are well suited to sharing on the web:
            retro gaming (especially PS1 and PC), fantasy and sci-fi (e.g.
            <em>D&D</em>, <em>Star Trek TNG</em>, <em>X-Files</em>) and a bit of
            Japanese pop-culture. In other words, I'm a millennial (or Gen Y, as
            we used to be called) nerd, bitten by the nostalgia bug.
        </p>
        <p>
            My homepage is not an attempt to document all of my interests or
            everything I do. I'm engaged in many things: being a dad and
            husband, hobbies (gardening, art, music, walking and reading), work,
            and trying to leave Earth a better place than I found it (not going
            well). Also, I live by the sea, which I love. But beyond this little
            statement, I don't really plan to talk about those things here.
        </p>
        <h2>Games</h2>
        <h3><em>Super RPG Town</em></h3>
        <p>
            I'm working on a playable demo of the core game loop, so will share
            more when that's ready. Inspired by the gameplay of
            <em>Majesty</em> and <em>Dragon Quest Builders</em>, the visual
            style of <em>Ultima V</em>, the spirit of
            <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and a feeling I can still remember
            of the first time I ever logged into an open-world MMORPG
            (<em>Dransik</em>) and took my first steps into what would become
            part of my life for years.

                EGM was a popular console game magazine my older brother and I
                read at high school in the late '90s. Scans of every issue are
                available! Go back to a time before mobile phones, revisit the
                emergence of the web, enjoy fan art sent in the mail, but most
                of all, relive the glory of PSX, N64, and the unexpectedly long
                run of the GameBoy thanks to a small game from Japan called
                <em>Pocket Monster</em> (also Sega consoles, <em>*sniff*</em>).

                Everybody's favourite long-haired, metal loving, retro-game
                collector (and pals). I decided not to collect physical games
                and stick to emulation, but I am happily live vicariously
                through Metal Jesus.

                An evergrowing list of illustrations I like on Dribbble, a
                portfolio site for graphic designers. There are definite themes
                to the style, colour palettes, and content ( irreverance,
                nature, and retro vibes). I like to scroll through this for
                inspiration.
