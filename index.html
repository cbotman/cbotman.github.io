    <h1>Chris Botman's homepage</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my homepage! A little place on the web I can go full-nerd. This
      is not a blog,
      <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/"
        >we're going old-school</a
      >
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a hobbiest game developer, sharing my game(s) and some of the
      inspiration behind them. Hopefully this will weave together threads of
      interest well suited to sharing on the web: retro gaming (especially PS1
      and PC era), fantasy and sci-fi (e.g.
      <em>D&D</em>, <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>X-Files</em>) and a bit of Japanese
      pop-culture. In other words, I'm a millennial (or Gen Y, as we used to be
      called) nerd, bitten by the nostalgia bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      My homepage is not an attempt to document all of my interests or
      everything I do. I'm engaged in many things: being a dad and husband,
      hobbies (gardening, art, music, reading, and being outside), work, and
      trying to leave Earth a better place than I found it (not going well). But
      beyond this little statement, I don't really plan to talk about those
      things here.

    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>Nostalgic sandbox/strategy games that respect your time.</p>
    <h3><em>Super RPG Town</em></h3>
    <p>
      I'm working on a playable demo of the core game loop, so will share more
      when that's ready. Inspired by the gameplay of
      <em>Majesty</em> and <em>Dragon Quest Builders</em>, the visual style of
      old 2D tile-based RPGs such as <em>Ultima V</em>, the spirit of countless
      <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> adventures, and a feeling I still remember
      from the first time I logged into an MMORPG (<em>Dransik</em>), created a
      character and set forwarth into a wide open world.

        EGM was a popular console game magazine my older brother and I read at
        high school in the late '90s. Check out scans of most issues! Go back to
        a time before mobile phones, revisit the emergence of the web, enjoy fan
        art sent in the mail, but most of all, relive the glory of PSX, N64, and
        the unexpectedly long run of the GameBoy thanks to a small game from
        Japan called <em>Pocket Monster</em> (also Sega consoles,
        <em>*sniff*</em>). Since browsing these scans, I've started collecting
        EGM issues from the 1996-2001 era...
