        <h1>Chris Botman's homepage</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my homepage! A small place on the web I can go full-nerd.
            This is not a blog,
            <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/"
                >we're going old-school</a
            >
            here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm an aspiring indie game developer, sharing my game(s) and some of
            the inspiration behind them. Hopefully this will weave together
            threads of interest that are well suited to sharing on the web:
            retro gaming (especially PS1 and PC), fantasy and sci-fi (e.g. D&D,
            Star Trek TNG, X-Files) and a bit of Japanese pop-culture. In other
            words, I'm a millennial (or Gen Y, as we used to be called) nerd,
            bitten by the nostalgia bug.
        </p>

            My homepage is not an attempt to document all of my interests or
            everything I do. I'm engaged in many things: being a dad and
            husband, hobbies (gardening, art, music, walking and reading), work,
            and trying to leave Earth a better place than I found it (not going
            well). Also, I live by the sea, which I love. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è But beyond this
            little statement, I don't really plan to talk about those things
            here.

        <h3>My RPG Town</h3>
        <p>
            Too early to show anything but I'm plugging away at a first demo.
            Inspired by the gameplay of Majesty and Dragon Quest Builders, and
            visual style of Ultima IV and Dransik.

                EGM was a popular console game magazine my older brother and I
                read at high school in the late '90s. Scans of every issue are
                available! Go back to a time before mobile phones, revisit the
                emergence of the web, enjoy fan art sent in the mail, but most
                of all, relive the glory of PSX, N64 and more (Sega consoles
                <em>*sniff*</em>).

                Everybody's favourite long-haired, metal loving retro game
                collector, and a nice guy to boot. I've decided not to try to
                collect physical games and stick to emulation, but I am happy to
                partake in MJR sharing his passion.
